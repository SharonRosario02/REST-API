# REST-API

Welcome to the User Management System repository! This project is a full-stack web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front-end, EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for templating, and Node.js with MongoDB on the backend to provide a powerful REST API for managing users.

Features:

1) Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for users.
2) Seamless photo upload functionality to personalize user profiles.
3) Secure user authentication and authorization.
4) Utilizes MongoDB to store user data for efficient retrieval and manipulation.

How to Run the Project:
1) To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:
2) Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or any preferred code editor.
3) Run npm install in the terminal to install the project dependencies. This ensures all required packages are downloaded.
4) MongoDB Configuration: Before running the application, make sure you update the MongoDB URL to connect to your database. You can do this using MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Atlas. Replace the existing MongoDB URL in the project with your own database URL in the appropriate configuration file.
5) Start the server: Run npm start in the terminal. This command initiates the project and starts the server.

Visit the application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. This is the default address where the application will be running.

Explore the User Management System: Now, you can fully explore the functionalities of the User Management System. Perform CRUD operations, manage user profiles, and experience the seamless photo upload feature.

Note: Please ensure that you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your local machine before proceeding with the steps above.
